    "# Getting Started MovieLens: ETL with NVTabular\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NVTabular is a feature engineering and preprocessing library for tabular data designed to quickly and easily manipulate terabyte scale datasets used to train deep learning based recommender systems.  It provides a high level abstraction to simplify code and accelerates computation on the GPU using the RAPIDS cuDF library.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning models require the input feature in a specific format. Categorical features needs to be continuous integers (0, ..., |C|) to use them with an embedding layer. We will use NVTabular to preprocess the categorical features.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One other challenge is multi-hot categorical features. A product can have multiple categories assigned, but the number of categories per product varies. For example, a movie can have one or multiple genres:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Father of the Bride Part II: \\[Comedy\\]\n",
    "- Toy Story: \\[Adventure, Animation, Children, Comedy, Fantasy\\]\n",
    "- Jumanji: \\[Adventure, Children, Fantasy\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy is often to use only the first category or the most frequent ones. However, a better strategy is to use all provided categories per datapoint. [RAPID cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) added list support in its [latest release v0.16](https://medium.com/rapids-ai/two-years-in-a-snap-rapids-0-16-ae797795a5c4) and  NVTabular supports multi-hot categorical features. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn how to `Categorify` single-hot and multi-hot categorical input features with NVTabular\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn NVTabular for using GPU-accelerated ETL (Preprocess and Feature Engineering)\n",
    "- Get familiar with NVTabular's high-level API\n",
    "- Join two dataframes with `JoinExternal` operator\n",
    "- Preprocess single-hot categorical input features with NVTabular\n",
    "- Preprocess multi-hot categorical input features with NVTabular\n",
    "- Use `LambdaOp` for custom row-wise dataframe manipulations with NVTabular"

    "### NVTabular\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rapid growth in scale of industry datasets, deep learning (DL) recommender models have started to gain advantages over traditional methods by capitalizing on large amounts of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current challenges for training large-scale recommenders include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Huge datasets:** Commercial recommenders are trained on huge datasets, often several terabytes in scale.\n",
    "* **Complex data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines:** Datasets need to be preprocessed and transformed into a form relevant to be used with DL models and frameworks. In addition, feature engineering creates an extensive set of new features from existing ones, requiring multiple iterations to arrive at an optimal solution.\n",
    "* **Input bottleneck:** Data loading, if not well optimized, can be the slowest part of the training process, leading to under-utilization of high-throughput computing devices such as GPUs.\n",
    "* **Extensive repeated experimentation:** The whole data engineering, training, and evaluation process is generally repeated many times, requiring significant time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NVTabular** is a library for fast tabular data transformation and loading, manipulating terabyte-scale datasets quickly. It provides best practices for feature engineering and preprocessing and a high-level abstraction to simplify code accelerating computation on the GPU using the RAPIDS cuDF library.\n",

    "### Why use NVTabular?\n",
    "\n",
    "NVTabular offers multiple advantages to support your Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Larger than memory datasets**: Your dataset size can be larger than host/GPU memory. NVTabular reads the data from disk and stores the processed files to disk. It will execute your pipeline without exceeding the memory boundaries.\n",
    "2. **Speed**: NVTabular will execute your pipeline on GPU. We experienced 10x-100x speed-up\n",
    "3. **Easy-to-use**: NVTabular implemented common feature engineering and preprocessing operators and provides high-level APIs ready to use"

The main purpose of this class is to abstract away the raw format of the data, and to allow other NVTabular classes to reliably materialize a dask_cudf.DataFrame collection (and/or collection-based iterator) on demand. Under the hood, the data decomposition corresponds to the construction of a [dask_cudf.DataFrame](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/dask-cudf.html) object.  By representing our dataset as a lazily-evaluated [Dask](https://dask.org/) collection, we can handle the calculation of complex global statistics (and later, can also iterate over the partitions while feeding data into a neural network). `part_size` defines the size read into GPU-memory at once."
